Amazon QuickSight powers data-driven organizations with unified business intelligence (BI) at hyperscale. With QuickSight, all users can meet varying analytic needs from the same source of truth through modern interactive dashboards, paginated reports, embedded analytics, and natural language queries.


Benefits
BI for everyone

	Deliver insights to all your users when, where, and how they need them. BI users can explore modern, interactive dashboards; get insights within their applications; obtain scheduled, formatted reports with Paginated Reports; and make forward-looking decisions with machine learning (ML) insights. To further simplify data exploration, QuickSight allows users to ask questions about the data in natural language.

Build faster

	Speed up development by using one authoring experience to build modern dashboards and paginated reports. Application developers can rapidly integrate rich analytics and ML-powered natural language query capabilities into applications with one-step embedding, public embedding, and rich APIs.
	
Scale efficiently

	Since QuickSight is serverless, automatically scale to tens of thousands of users without the need to set up, configure, or manage your own servers. The QuickSight in-memory calculation engine, SPICE, provides consistently fast response times for end users and analysts, removing the need to scale databases for high workloads.
	
Lower costs

	Pay only for what you use with the QuickSight usage-based pricing. No need to buy thousands of end-user licenses for large-scale BI or embedded analytics deployments. With no software or servers to install or manage, you can lower costs by removing upfront costs and complex capacity planning.
