We created a JavaScript-based tool that allows you to calculate your monthly cost for using [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3), [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2), and [Amazon SQS](http://aws.amazon.com/sqs).

This tool incorporates the latest pricing changes including the tiered pricing model for download bandwidth.

Use this tool to estimate your monthly bill, to determine your best and worst case scenarios (if you get Slashdotted, Dugg etc.), and identify areas of development to reduce your monthly costs and even compare it with other service providers who do not offer utility-style of billing (pay-as-you-go).
