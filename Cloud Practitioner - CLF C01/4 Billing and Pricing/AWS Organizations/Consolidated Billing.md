![[Pasted image 20230403171635.png]]



You can use the consolidated billing feature in AWS Organizations to consolidate billing and payment for multiple AWS accounts or multiple Amazon Web Services India Private Limited (AWS India) accounts. Every organization in AWS Organizations has a _management account_ that pays the charges of all the _member accounts_. For more information about organizations, see the [AWS Organizations User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/).

Consolidated billing has the following benefits:

-   **One bill** – You get one bill for multiple accounts.
    
-   **Easy tracking** – You can track the charges across multiple accounts and download the combined cost and usage data.
    
-   **Combined usage** – You can combine the usage across all accounts in the organization to share the volume pricing discounts, Reserved Instance discounts, and Savings Plans. This can result in a lower charge for your project, department, or company than with individual standalone accounts. For more information, see [Volume discounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/useconsolidatedbilling-effective.html#useconsolidatedbilling-discounts).
    
-   **No extra fee** – Consolidated billing is offered at no additional cost.
