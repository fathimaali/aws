## How it works

With AWS Budgets, set custom budgets to track your costs and usage, and respond quickly to alerts received from email or SNS notifications if you exceed your threshold.

## Use cases

### Monitor costs and usage
	Set your preferred budget period to daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually, and create specific budget limits.

### Create scheduled reports
	Stay informed on how actual or forecasted costs and usage progress toward your budget threshold.

### Respond to thresholds
	Set up custom actions to run automatically or through an approval process when a budget target is exceeded.
