AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage **your AWS costs and usage over time.** Get started quickly by creating custom reports that analyze cost and usage data. Analyze your data at a high level (for example, total costs and usage across all accounts), or dive deeper into your cost and usage data to identify trends, pinpoint cost drivers, and detect anomalies.  

## How it works

You can [enable Cost Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-enable.html) for your account using this procedure on the Billing and Cost Management console. You can't enable Cost Explorer using the API. After you enable Cost Explorer, AWS prepares the data about your costs for the current month and the last 12 months, and then calculates the forecast for the next 12 months. The current month's data is available for viewing in about 24 hours. The rest of your data takes a few days longer. Cost Explorer updates your cost data at least once every 24 hours.
