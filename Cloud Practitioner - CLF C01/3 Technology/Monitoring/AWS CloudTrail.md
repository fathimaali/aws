## Use cases

### Audit activity
  
	Monitor, store, and validate activity events for authenticity. Easily generate audit reports required by internal policies and external regulations.  

### Identify security incidents
  
	Detect unauthorized access using the Who, What, and When information in CloudTrail Events. Respond with rules-based EventBridge alerts and automated workflows.  

### Troubleshoot operational issues

	Continuously monitor API usage history using machine learning (ML) models to spot unusual activity in your AWS accounts, and determine root cause.
