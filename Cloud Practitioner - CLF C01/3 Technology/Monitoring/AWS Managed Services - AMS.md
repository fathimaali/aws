AWS Managed Services (AMS) helps you adopt AWS at scale and operate more efficiently and securely. We leverage standard AWS services and offer guidance and execution of operational best practices with specialized automations, skills, and experience that are contextual to your environment and applications. AMS provides proactive, preventative, and detective capabilities that raise the operational bar and help reduce risk without constraining agility, allowing you to focus on innovation. AMS extends your team with operational capabilities including monitoring, incident management, [AWS Incident Detection and Response](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/aws-incident-detection-response/), security, patch, backup, and cost optimization.

# Use cases

### Monitoring & Observability

	To establish a strong foundation for securely operating your workloads in the cloud, it is critical to consider how you plan to monitor the health of your workloads. An observable environment reduces risk, increases agility, and improves customer experience. AMS elevates operational excellence with 24x7x365 proactive monitoring of activity and incidents to ensure availability and resiliency. Through automation, AMS detects and proactively notifies customers of 80% of incidents, increasing as we continue to learn from experience.  
  

### Configuration, Compliance & Auditing

	Organizations operate in a compliance landscape that is complex, dynamic, and evolving rapidly, facing internal requirements as well as external industry, national, and international regulations. AMS offers customers an accelerated path towards meeting compliance certifications and attestations against PCI-DSS, HIPAA, HiTrust, GDPR, ISO, SOC 1, 2 and 3. AMS helps customers configure their environment to be secure by providing time-tested safety mechanisms aligned with NIST, 150+ managed guardrails and security checks, and the most up-to-date best practices.  

### Centralized Operations Management

	The cloud landscape is constantly evolving, and keeping up with new security threats can be time consuming, costly, and require ample cloud talent. AMS scales our customers’ operational capabilities and constantly evolves to meet their changing needs. The AMS operating model is based on a continuous learning mechanism that evaluates workloads and pipelines against changing security policies. With every interaction, we iterate and improve customers’ operating models, through tuning alarms, creating automations, and adding new monitors and service level indicators.  

### Enterprise Governance & Controls

	In order to provide transparency in governance, we offer reporting from various native AWS services to summarize key performance metrics of AMS, including an executive summary and cost-saving insights, as well as granular details of incidents and performance. AMS allows enforcing of AMS and non-AMS tags to ensure they comply with enterprise governance and auditing control. AMS can take over administration and maintenance of Control Tower environments and offer monitoring and remediation.
