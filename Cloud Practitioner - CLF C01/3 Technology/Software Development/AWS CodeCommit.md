## Use cases

### Collaborate on code

Implement workflows that include code reviews and feedback by default, and control who can make changes to specific branches.

### Use your existing tools

Keep using your preferred development environment plugins, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) systems, and graphical clients.

### Receive notifications and custom scripts

Get Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) notifications for events impacting your repositories, and send notifications to create HTTP webhooks.

### Create up to 1,000 repositories by default

Generate up to 25,000 additional repositories by request, and store and version any kind of file.
