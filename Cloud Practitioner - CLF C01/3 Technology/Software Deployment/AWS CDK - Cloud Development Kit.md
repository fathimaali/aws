AWS Cloud Development Kit.

Instead of using CloudFormation that uses yaml, with CDK you can use your own programming language. 

Code written will be compiled by the CDK into a usuable CloudFormation template. 

can deploy application and infrastructure code together as programming language is the same. 

use case : 

Lambda 
ECS, EKS -> Docker container.
