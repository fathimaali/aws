Batch processing, ML model training, and analysis at any scale

## How it works

AWS Batch lets developers, scientists, and engineers efficiently run hundreds of thousands of batch and ML computing jobs while optimizing compute resources, so you can focus on analyzing results and solving problems.

Intro to AWS Batch (1:37)

Fully managed batch processing

AWS Batch is a fully managed batch computing service that plans, schedules, and runs your containerized batch or ML workloads across the full range of AWS compute offerings, such as Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, AWS Fargate, and Spot or On-Demand Instances.  

## Use cases

### Run financial services analyses

Automate analyses of the day’s transaction costs, completion reports, and market performance.

### Screen for drugs and sequence genomes

Rapidly search libraries of small molecules to capture better data for drug design.

### Render visual effects

Automate content-rendering workloads and reduce the need for human intervention due to dependencies.

### Train ML models

Efficiently run compute-intense ML model training and inference at any scale.
