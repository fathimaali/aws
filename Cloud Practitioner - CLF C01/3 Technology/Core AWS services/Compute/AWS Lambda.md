Run code without provisioning or managing infrastructure. Simply write and upload code as a .zip file or container image.  

Automatically respond to code execution requests at any scale, from a dozen events per day to hundreds of thousands per second.  

Save costs by paying only for the compute time you use—by per-millisecond—instead of provisioning infrastructure upfront for peak capacity.  

Optimize code execution time and performance with the right function memory size. Respond to high demand in double-digit milliseconds with Provisioned Concurrency.  

## How it works

AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications, and only pay for what you use.

Lambda is triggered to run resizing code, and the photo is resized.](https://d1.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/Lambda/Diagrams/product-page-diagram_Lambda-RealTimeFileProcessing.a59577de4b6471674a540b878b0b684e0249a18c.png "How it works diagram of AWS Lambda")
    
## Use cases

### Process data at scale

  
Execute code at the capacity you need, as you need it. Scale to match your data volume automatically and enable custom event triggers.  

### Run interactive web and mobile backends

Combine AWS Lambda with other AWS services to create secure, stable, and scalable online experiences.  

### Enable powerful ML insights

Preprocess data before feeding it to your machine learning (ML) model. With Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) access, AWS Lambda handles infrastructure management and provisioning to simplify scaling.  

### Create event-driven applications

Build event-driven functions for easy communication between decoupled services. Reduce costs by running applications during times of peak demand without crashing or over-provisioning resources.
