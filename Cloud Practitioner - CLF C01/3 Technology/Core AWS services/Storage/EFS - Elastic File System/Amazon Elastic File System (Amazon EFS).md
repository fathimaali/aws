Serverless, fully elastic file storage 

https://aws.amazon.com/efs/ 

**EFS** - Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. It is built to scale on-demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, eliminating the need to provision and manage capacity to accommodate growth. Amazon EFS is a regional service storing data within and across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability and durability.

## How it works

Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) automatically grows and shrinks as you add and remove files with no need for management or provisioning.
