	Realize microsecond response times across hundreds of millions of operations per second and up to 1 pebibyte of data (with data tiering).  

	Attain 99.99% SLA with Multi-AZ deployments and bolster disaster recovery in less than a minute through cross-Region replication.             

	Achieve cost-optimized performance by adding a cache for frequently read data to optimize resources and lower total cost of ownership.  

	Build applications quickly using popular open-source technologies, Redis and Memcached, and easily integrate with other AWS services.                     


## How it works

Amazon ElastiCache is a fully managed, Redis- and Memcached-compatible service delivering real-time, cost-optimized performance for modern applications. ElastiCache scales to hundreds of millions of operations per second with microsecond response time, and offers enterprise-grade security and reliability.

## Use cases

### Lower total cost of ownership

Cache your data and offload database I/O to reduce operational burden, lower costs, and improve performance of both the database and the application.  

### Real-time application data caching

Store frequently used data in-memory for microsecond response times and high throughput to support hundreds of millions of operations per second.  

### Real-time session stores

Store ephemeral session data to quickly personalize gaming, e-commerce, social media, and online applications with microsecond response times  

### Real-time leaderboards

Simplify application development with ElastiCache built-in data structures.
