[[RDS]]'s  Shared Responsibility model 

https://aws.amazon.com/rds/  

	Remove inefficient and time-consuming database administrative tasks without needing to provision infrastructure or maintain software.  

	Deploy and scale the relational database engines of your choice in the cloud or on-premises.  

	Achieve high availability with Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments.  

	Benefit from over a decade of proven operational expertise, security best practices, and innovation in databases born in the cloud.  

## How it works

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a collection of managed services that makes it simple to set up, operate, and scale databases in the cloud. Choose from seven popular engines — [Amazon Aurora with MySQL compatibility](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/?pg=ln&sec=hiw), [Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL compatibility](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/?pg=ln&sec=hiw), [MySQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/?pg=ln&sec=hiw), [MariaDB](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mariadb/?pg=ln&sec=hiw), [PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/?pg=ln&sec=hiw), [Oracle](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/oracle/?pg=ln&sec=hiw), and [SQL Server](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/?pg=ln&sec=hiw) — and deploy on-premises with [Amazon RDS on AWS Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/outposts/?pg=ln&sec=hiw).

## Use cases

### Build web and mobile applications

Support growing apps with high availability, throughput, and storage scalability. Take advantage of flexible pay-per-use pricing to suit various application usage patterns.  

### Move to managed databases

  
Innovate and build new apps with Amazon RDS instead of worrying about self-managing your databases, which can be time consuming, complex, and expensive.  

### Break free from legacy databases

Free yourself from expensive, punitive, commercial databases by migrating to [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/?pg=ln&sec=uc). When you migrate to Aurora, you get the scalability, performance, and availability of commercial databases at 1/10th the cost.
