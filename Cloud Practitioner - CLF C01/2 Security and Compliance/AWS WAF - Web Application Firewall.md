## How it works

AWS WAF helps you protect against common web exploits and bots that can affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.

![Diagram showing how AWS WAF integrates with other AWS services to protect your web applications from exploits.](https://d1.awsstatic.com/Product-Page-Diagram_AWS-Web-Application-Firewall%402x.5f24d1b519ed1a88b7278c5d4cf7e4eeaf9b75cf.png)


With AWS WAF, you can create security rules that control bot traffic and block common attack patterns such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

## Use cases

### Filter web traffic

	Create rules to filter web requests based on conditions such as IP addresses, HTTP headers and body, or custom URIs.

### Prevent account takeover fraud

	Monitor your applicationâ€™s login page for unauthorized access to user accounts using compromised credentials.

### Administer AWS WAF with APIs

	Create and maintain rules automatically and incorporate them into the development and design process.
