## Use cases

### Quickly discover vulnerabilities in compute workloads

Automatically discover and quickly route vulnerability findings in near real time to the appropriate teams so they can take immediate action.  

### Prioritize patch remediation

Use up-to-date common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) information combined with factors such as network accessibility to create context-based risk scores that help you prioritize and address vulnerable resources.  

### Meet compliance requirements

Support compliance requirements and best practices for NIST CSF, PCI DSS, and other regulations with Amazon Inspector scans.  

### Identify zero-day vulnerabilities sooner

Accelerate MTTR by using over 50 sources for vulnerability intelligence to help identify zero-day vulnerabilities quickly.
