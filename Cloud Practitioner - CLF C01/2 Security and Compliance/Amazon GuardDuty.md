## How it works

Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors your AWS accounts and workloads for malicious activity and delivers detailed security findings for visibility and remediation.

## Use cases

### Improve security operations visibility

	Gain insight of compromised credentials, unusual data access in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), suspicious logins in Amazon Aurora, and API calls from known malicious IP addresses.  

### Assist analysts in investigations and automate remediation

	Receive findings with context, metadata, and impacted resource details. Determine root cause with [Amazon Detective](https://aws.amazon.com/detective/). Route findings to [AWS Security](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/) Hub and [Amazon EventBridge.](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/)  

### Identify files containing malware

	Scan Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) for files that might have malware creating suspicious behavior on instance and container workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).  

### Detect and mitigate threats in your container environment

	Identify and profile possible malicious or suspicious behavior in container workloads by analyzing [Amazon EKS audit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html) logs and container runtime activity.
