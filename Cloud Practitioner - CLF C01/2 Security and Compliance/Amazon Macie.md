## How it works

Amazon Macie is a data security service that uses machine learning (ML) and pattern matching to discover and help protect your sensitive data.

![Diagram showing how Macie automates the discovery of sensitive data to provide you with a better understanding of the data that your organization stores within Amazon S3.](https://d1.awsstatic.com/reInvent/reinvent-2022/macie/Product-Page-Diagram_Amazon-Macie.a51550cca0a731ba2e4a26e8463ed5f5a81202e3.png)


Amazon Macie discovers sensitive data using machine learning and pattern matching, provides visibility into data security risks, and enables automated protection against those risks.

## Use cases

### Strengthen your data security posture

	Discover sensitive data across your S3 environment to increase visibility and automated remediation of data security risks.

### Discover sensitive data for compliance

	Schedule data analysis to certify that sensitive data is discovered and protected.

### Protect sensitive data during migration

### Increase visibility for business-critical data

	Automatically and continually monitor all your sensitive data stored in S3 buckets.
