## How it works

Amazon Detective simplifies the investigative process and helps security teams conduct faster and more effective investigations. With the Amazon Detective prebuilt data aggregations, summaries, and context, you can quickly analyze and determine the nature and extent of possible security issues.

Amazon Detective automatically collects log data from your AWS resources and uses machine learning (ML), statistical analysis, and graph theory to build a linked dataset that you can use to conduct more efficient security investigations.

## Use cases

### Triage security findings

	Verify or disprove suspicious findings by investigating AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, users, IP addresses, and AWS accounts.

### Investigate incidents

	Determine the extent of malicious activity, its impact, and the underlying cause by analyzing relevant historical activities for patterns.

### Track down threats

	Focus on specific resources, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, and review detailed visualizations of associated activities.
