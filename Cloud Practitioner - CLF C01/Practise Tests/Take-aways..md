[[AWS CodeDeploy]] vs [[AWS CodePipeline]] 

AWS CodeDeploy is a service that automates code deployments to any instance, including Amazon EC2 instances and instances running on-premises. AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications. You can use AWS CodeDeploy to automate deployments, eliminating the need for error-prone manual operations, and the service scales with your infrastructure so you can easily deploy to one instance or thousands.

AWS CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service that enables you to model, visualize, and automate the steps required to release your software. With AWS CodePipeline, you model the full release process for building your code, deploying to pre-production environments, testing your application and releasing it to production.

[[Cloud Practitioner - CLF C01/3 Technology/Core AWS services/Storage/EFS - Elastic File System/Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)]] -- EC2 instances can access files on an EFS file system across many Availability Zones, Regions and VPCs

[[Cloud Practitioner - CLF C01/3 Technology/Core AWS services/Compute/EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud/AMI - Amazon Machine Image]] -- You must use an AMI from the same region as that of the EC2 instance. The region of the AMI has no bearing on the performance of the EC2 instance
AMI provides the information required to launch an instance. You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you need multiple instances with the same configuration.

[[Cloud Practitioner - CLF C01/3 Technology/Core AWS services/Storage/EFS - Elastic File System/Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)]]
Correct option: **Storing files in an accessible location to satisfy audit requirements** - The Standardâ€“IA storage class reduces storage costs for files that are not accessed every day. It does this without sacrificing the high availability, high durability, elasticity, and POSIX file system access that Amazon EFS provides.
AWS recommends Standard-IA storage if you need your full dataset to be readily accessible and want to automatically save on storage costs for files that are less frequently accessed. Examples include keeping files accessible to satisfy audit requirements, performing historical analysis, or performing backup and recovery. Standard-IA storage is compatible with all Amazon EFS features, and is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon EFS is available.

[[Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS)]] - 
Amazon EBS Snapshots are stored incrementally, which means you are billed only for the changed blocks stored - Amazon EBS Snapshots are a point in time copy of your block data. For the first snapshot of a volume, Amazon EBS saves a full copy of your data to Amazon S3. EBS Snapshots are stored incrementally, which means you are billed only for the changed blocks stored.

[[EFS IA - EFS Infrequent Access]] 
You will pay a fee each time you read from or write data stored on the EFS - Infrequent Access storage class - The Infrequent Access storage class is cost-optimized for files accessed less frequently. Data stored on the Infrequent Access storage class costs less than Standard and you will pay a fee each time you read from or write to a file.
