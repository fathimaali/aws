AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. Using AWS Auto Scaling, it’s easy to setup application scaling for multiple resources across multiple services in minutes. The service provides a simple, powerful user interface that lets you build scaling plans for resources including [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instances and Spot Fleets, [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) tasks, [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) tables and indexes, and [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/aurora/) Replicas. AWS Auto Scaling makes scaling simple with recommendations that allow you to optimize performance, costs, or balance between them. If you’re already using [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/) to dynamically scale your Amazon EC2 instances, you can now combine it with AWS Auto Scaling to scale additional resources for other AWS services. With AWS Auto Scaling, your applications always have the right resources at the right time.

It’s easy to get started with AWS Auto Scaling using the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home), Command Line Interface (CLI), or SDK. AWS Auto Scaling is available at no additional charge. You pay only for the AWS resources needed to run your applications and [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) monitoring fees.
