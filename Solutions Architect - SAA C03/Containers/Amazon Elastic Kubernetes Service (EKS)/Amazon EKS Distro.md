An open-source distribution of Kubernetes from AWS

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) uses Amazon EKS Distro, a Kubernetes distribution built and maintained by AWS. Amazon EKS Distro makes it easier to create reliable and secure clusters.

What is the difference between EKS (the AWS Kubernetes cloud service) and EKS-D? The main difference is in how they are managed. **EKS is a fully managed Kubernetes platform, while EKS-D is available to install and manage yourself**. You can run EKS-D on-premises, in a cloud, or on your own systems.
