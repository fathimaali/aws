		RPO - point in time when the backup has happened, so meaning how often do we perform our backup, and what is the latest point in time for which we have backup
		in case a disaster strikes, the time between our disaster and RPO would be the time of data loss
		RTO - the difference in time between the disaster and the RTO would be the downtime, so basically how long in time would we need before the recovery happens
