can afford to run the app in a smaller workload for a while, run critical stuff in the app, until we have the full app running 

for critical apps that cannot afford downtime for critical parts of the app, but can afford to run on reduced workloads until RTO

faster than [[1 Backup and Restore|1 Backup and Restore]] because critical systems are running 
lower RTO and RPO compared to [[1 Backup and Restore|1 Backup and Restore]] 
doesnt cost a lot
