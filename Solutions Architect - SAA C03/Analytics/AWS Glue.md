#### Below we define and explain AWS Glue.

AWS Glue consists of multiple discrete services that combined provide both visual and code-based interfaces to simplify the process of preparing and combining data for analytics, machine learning, and application development:

-   The **AWS Glue Data Catalog** is a central metadata repository for quickly finding and accessing data.
-   **AWS Glue Studio** provides data engineers with a visual UI for creating, scheduling, running, and monitoring ETL workflows.Â  It handles dependency resolution, job monitoring, and retries.
-   **AWS Glue DataBrew** enables data analysts and data scientists to visually enrich, clean, and normalize data without writing code.
-   **AWS Glue Elastic Views** give application developers the ability to use familiar SQL to combine and replicate data across different data stores.
