The AWS Serverless Application Repository is a managed repository for serverless applications. It enables teams, organizations, and individual developers to store and share reusable applications, and easily assemble and deploy serverless architectures in powerful new ways. Using the Serverless Application Repository, you don't need to clone, build, package, or publish source code to AWS before deploying it. Instead, you can use pre-built applications from the Serverless Application Repository in your serverless architectures, helping you and your teams reduce duplicated work, ensure organizational best practices, and get to market faster. Integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides resource-level control of each application, enabling you to publicly share applications with everyone or privately share them with specific AWS accounts. To share an application you've built, [publish it to the AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://console.aws.amazon.com/serverlessrepo/home?locale=en&region=us-east-1#/published-applications).

Each application is packaged with an [AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) template that defines the AWS resources used. Publicly shared applications also include a link to the applicationâ€™s source code. There is no additional charge to use the Serverless Application Repository - you only pay for the AWS resources used in the applications you deploy.
