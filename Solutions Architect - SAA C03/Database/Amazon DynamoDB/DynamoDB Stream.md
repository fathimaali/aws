DynamoDB Streams is a feature of Amazon DynamoDB that provides a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications made to data in a DynamoDB table. These modifications can include both inserts and updates of the items in the table. DynamoDB Streams can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

1.  Building search indexes: DynamoDB Streams can be used to maintain a search index in real-time, ensuring that the index is always up-to-date with the latest changes to the data.
    
2.  Data replication: DynamoDB Streams can be used to replicate data between DynamoDB tables or even between different data stores.
    
3.  Triggering downstream processes: DynamoDB Streams can be used to trigger Lambda functions or other downstream processes based on changes to data in DynamoDB.
    
4.  Event-driven architectures: DynamoDB Streams can be used as an event source for building event-driven architectures, where changes to data in DynamoDB trigger other events or processes.
    

Overall, DynamoDB Streams can be used for a wide range of use cases that require real-time processing and analysis of changes to data in DynamoDB.
