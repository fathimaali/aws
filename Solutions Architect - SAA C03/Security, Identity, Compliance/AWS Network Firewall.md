Deploy network firewall security across your VPCs
With AWS Network Firewall, you can define firewall rules that provide fine-grained control over network traffic. Network Firewall works together with AWS Firewall Manager so you can build policies based on Network Firewall rules and then centrally apply those policies across your virtual private clouds (VPCs) and accounts.
