[[AWS SSM - Systems Manager]] 

SSM Parameter Store is primarily used for storing configuration data, such as database connection strings, API keys, and other application settings. Parameter Store provides a simple key-value store for storing this information, and also allows you to organize your data using hierarchies and tags. Parameter Store supports multiple versions of each parameter, and also allows you to encrypt your data using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for added security.
